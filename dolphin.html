    Dolphin is the common name of aquatic mammals within the infraorder Cetacea. The term dolphin usually refers to the extant families Delphinidae, Platanistidae, Iniidae, Pontoporiidae, and the extinct Lipotidae. There are 40 extant species named as dolphins. There are about 600,000 dolphins in the world, and the average lifespan varies depending on the type of dolphins, such as orcas living between 10-45 years and striped dolphins living from 55-60 years.
