      The polar bear is a hypercarnivorous bear whose native range lies largely within the Arctic Circle, 
      encompassing the Arctic Ocean, its surrounding seas and surrounding land masses. 
      It is the largest extant bear species, as well as the largest extant land carnivore. 
      They weigh an average of 330 to 550 pounds as an adult, and are between the height of 5.9 feet to 7.9 feet as an adult. 
      They are currently classified as a vulnerable series, due to the result of habitat loss caused from climate change.
